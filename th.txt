queue adt - fifo 
addition from the rear end and deletion from the front end
data :
1. space for storing elements
2. front - for deletion
3. rear - for insertion

operations:
enqueue(), dequeue(), isEmpty(), isFull(), first(), last()
implemented by array and linked list

1. implementation by array
-> queue using single pointer
-> queue using front and rear
-> drawbacks of queue using array
single ptr : insertion tc - O(1), deletion tc - O(n)
two pts : enqueue tc - O(1), dequeue tc - O(1)
initially -> front=rear=-1
empty -> if(front=rear)
full -> if(rear=size-1)
